3. There is also a notebook project from Netflix called Polynote that support Scala and Python interop. 
    I think they opted for not making a Jupiter kernel because of the need for fast code completion.

4. For polyglot reproducible literate programming, there is also https://nextjournal.com (implemented in Clojure/Clojurescript).
5. CIDER has been the best programming environment I have experienced (probably haven't tried enough of SLIME though). It combines coding with dynamic experimentation in such a fun way.
    For literate programming, the Clojure/Clojurescript ecosystem keeps bringing up fascinating environments (in addition to CIDER+Org-mode and Clojupyter).

    are all actively developed and worth following, and they are all rather innovative in the ideas they bring to the table.
